An e-commerce application for an Ice cream shop named "The Ice cream Factory" and it also has an admin panel.
This is a web application to order ice cream to your doorstep from the “Ice-cream Factory” chain
of stores or place an order prior to your arrival at the store such that it reduces the waiting time at
the store. The steps involve signing up and logging in, selecting an ice cream of your choice
from the menu displayed or searching for an ice cream using our search page and finally
checkout which redirects you to the payment where you enter your billing information. The
customers are also allowed to rate the ice creams which will in turn be displayed as an average
rating for each ice cream in the menu page. Our potential users will be people who have sweet
tooth and are inclined towards ice cream. We offer services like registering an account with our
website, providing menu and information about the store apart from collecting feedback and
ratings from our customers.
